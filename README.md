# NBA Players API
This repository contains the code for a Flask API built to provide players' stats, images and team logos from the 2022-23 season of the NBA.
\
It applies a 100 minute mimimum threshold to the players list.

To access the data, use the following endpoints [here](nba-players-api-alpha.vercel.app):\
/players: access to all the players stats\
/player_images: access to an image for each player\
/teams: access to a logo for each team
